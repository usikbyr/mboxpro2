Drivers for windows 10 of the audio interface digidesign mbox pro 2 firewire

After many hours, I found out a radical solution in order to use my audio interface firewire on a windows 10 environment :
Copy the temp installation file from the official package, copy the MSI installation files for mbox pro 2 and then run installation and extract the cab file.

Hope it will help you.

Of course all rights remain to Avid company. It is just a help for people who want to use the interface
